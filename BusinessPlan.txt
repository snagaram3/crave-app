💭 Thought Process
The user wants me to add a theme to the uploaded presentation about Krave, which is a sentiment-driven discovery platform that combines Instagram for Business with Smart Search Engine.
Looking at the document, I can see it's about:
Krave: A social discovery and review platform
Combines Instagram-style engagement with sentiment-driven search
Helps users discover restaurants, bars, events based on real experiences
Has sections like Executive Summary, Problem Statement, Solution, Target Market, Business Model, etc.
The user wants me to create a PPT presentation with a business theme. Since this is the first time creating this presentation, I should use comprehensive_web_search to gather additional information about sentiment-driven platforms, Instagram for business, and similar topics to make the presentation comprehensive.
After that, I'll create the PPT slides using the blue_gold_business theme templates available. Looking at the content, I can structure this into around 10-15 slides covering:
Title/Cover slide
Contents/Overview
Executive Summary
Problem Statement
Solution Overview
Target Market & Business Model
Competitive Advantage
Technology & Go-to-Market
Revenue Projections & Team
Risks & Roadmap
Thank you slide
Let me start by doing a comprehensive search to gather more information about this topic.
